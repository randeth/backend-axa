Backend Assestment AXA

In this assesment I used the following resources:
-express: this is the framework I decided to use
-jsonwebtoken: an easy way to manage login and information about the client
-mongoose: I decided to use MongoDB and mongoose is really nice to work with stored data
-nodemon: monitoring tool for the nodejs project
-dotenv: I stored passwords, port numbers, etc in a .env file and this package makes it easier to use

All the data is stored in a free MongoDB server at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud. The data is taken from (Clients) http://www.mocky.io/v2/5808862710000087232b75ac and (policies) http://www.mocky.io/v2/580891a4100000e8242b75c5
